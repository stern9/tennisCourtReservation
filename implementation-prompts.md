# Tennis Booking Automation - Implementation Prompts

## Step 1.1: DynamoDB Local Setup & Schema Creation

### Context
This is the first step in migrating a tennis court booking automation system from .env configuration to DynamoDB. We need to establish the data foundation with proper schema design and local development setup.

### Prompt 1.1

   - BookingRequests: Store individual booking requests with TTL
   - SystemConfig: Store application settings and court configurations

3. Implement basic CRUD operations using boto3
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for all data operations
5. Create a simple script to populate test data

Table Schema Requirements:
- UserConfigs: userId (PK), username, password, preferredCourt, timestamps
- BookingRequests: requestId (PK), userId (SK), courtId, date, timeSlot, status, TTL
- SystemConfig: configKey (PK), configValue, description, lastModified

Create a clean, testable foundation that follows DynamoDB best practices. Include proper error handling and logging.
