# Step 2.3 Summary: Booking Request Service

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive booking request service with court-specific validation, status tracking, and lifecycle management. The service provides complete booking management capabilities including validation, conflict detection, scheduling, and cleanup operations.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Booking Service (`src/api/services/booking_service.py`)
- **Court-specific availability validation** with configurable booking windows
- **Conflict detection** for overlapping bookings
- **User permission validation** including daily booking limits
- **Status transition management** with validation rules
- **Booking lifecycle methods** (process, confirm, fail, expire, cancel)
- **TTL-based cleanup** for old bookings and expired requests

### 2. Enhanced Booking Endpoints (`src/api/routers/bookings.py`)
- **POST /bookings** - Create new booking requests with validation
- **GET /bookings** - List user's booking history with pagination
- **GET /bookings/{booking_id}** - Get specific booking details
- **PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/status** - Update booking status (admin/system)
- **DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}** - Cancel booking requests
- **GET /bookings/availability/courts** - Get court availability information
- **POST /bookings/validate** - Validate booking requests without creating
- **POST /bookings/cleanup** - Manual cleanup of old bookings

### 3. Booking Status Management (`src/api/models.py`)
- **Enhanced BookingStatus enum** with PROCESSING state
- **Status transition validation** preventing invalid state changes
- **Booking lifecycle tracking** with timestamps and messages

### 4. Data Access Layer Enhancements (`src/dao/booking_request_dao.py`)
- **Conflict detection queries** for overlapping bookings
- **User booking limits** checking daily booking counts
- **TTL cleanup methods** for old bookings and expired requests
- **Status-based filtering** for processing workflows

### 5. Booking Lifecycle Management (`src/api/services/booking_lifecycle_service.py`)
- **Complete lifecycle event handling** for booking state transitions
- **Automatic processing** of pending and scheduled bookings
- **Retry logic** for failed bookings with exponential backoff
- **Notification system** integration points
- **Lifecycle statistics** and monitoring

### 6. Scheduler Integration (`src/api/services/scheduler_service.py`)
- **Enhanced cleanup tasks** using booking service methods
- **Automated TTL processing** for old bookings and expired requests
- **Background job scheduling** for booking lifecycle events

### 7. Comprehensive Integration Tests (`tests/test_booking_service_integration.py`)
- **End-to-end booking workflow** testing
- **Validation logic** testing with court-specific rules
- **Status transition** testing with valid/invalid scenarios
- **Conflict detection** testing for overlapping bookings
- **User permission** testing for daily limits
- **Cleanup operations** testing for TTL functionality

## Key Features Implemented

### Booking Validation
- **Court-specific availability windows** (configurable per court)
- **Date/time validation** ensuring future bookings only
- **Conflict detection** preventing double bookings
- **User permission checks** with daily booking limits
- **Comprehensive validation messages** for user feedback

### Status Tracking
- **Complete status lifecycle**: pending → processing → confirmed/failed
- **Status transition validation** preventing invalid state changes
- **Scheduled booking support** for future availability windows
- **Retry logic** for failed bookings with configurable limits

### Lifecycle Management
- **Event-driven architecture** for booking state changes
- **Automatic processing** of pending and scheduled bookings
- **Background job integration** for midnight booking attempts
- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

### Cleanup Operations
- **TTL-based cleanup** removing old completed bookings
- **Automatic expiration** of stale pending requests
- **Manual cleanup endpoints** for administrative operations
- **Configurable retention periods** for different booking states

```

## Integration Points

### With User Management (Step 2.2)
- **User authentication** required for all booking endpoints
- **User context** used for permission validation
- **User ID** tracked in all booking operations

### With Configuration API (Step 2.1)
- **Court availability windows** configurable per court
- **Booking limits** configurable per user
- **Retry logic** configurable for failed bookings

### With Background Scheduler
- **Midnight booking attempts** for scheduled requests
- **Cleanup jobs** for TTL maintenance
- **Retry scheduling** for failed bookings

## Testing Results

### Integration Tests
- **14 comprehensive test scenarios** covering all booking workflows
- **Mock-heavy testing** for isolated unit testing
- **Court-specific validation** with realistic test data
- **Status transition testing** with valid/invalid scenarios
- **Cleanup operation testing** with TTL functionality

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Booking request creation and validation
- ✅ Conflict detection and resolution
- ✅ User permission validation
- ✅ Status transition management
- ✅ Lifecycle event handling
- ✅ Cleanup operations
- ✅ Court availability calculations

## Current Status and Readiness

### Completed Features
- ✅ All core booking request endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive validation logic
- ✅ Status tracking and lifecycle management
- ✅ TTL-based cleanup operations
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Booking lifecycle management

### Integration Ready
- **User authentication** - Ready for user context
- **Tennis script integration** - Ready for Step 2.4
- **Database operations** - All CRUD operations implemented
- **Background processing** - Scheduler integration complete

### Performance Considerations
- **Conflict detection** uses efficient database queries
- **TTL cleanup** runs as background jobs
- **Pagination** implemented for large result sets
- **Status indexing** for fast filtering

## Next Steps (Step 2.4)

The booking request service is now ready for integration with the tennis booking script. The service provides:

1. **Complete booking lifecycle management** for script integration
2. **Status tracking** for monitoring script execution
3. **Retry logic** for handling script failures
4. **Cleanup operations** for maintaining database hygiene

### Prerequisites for Step 2.4
- ✅ Booking request data model complete
- ✅ Status tracking infrastructure ready
- ✅ User authentication and permissions
- ✅ Background job scheduling
- ✅ Database operations and cleanup

### Integration Points for Step 2.4
- **BookingLifecycleService** ready for tennis script callbacks
- **Status transition methods** for script result handling
- **Retry logic** for script execution failures
- **Configuration loading** from database instead of .env

## Notes

### Security
- All booking endpoints require authentication
- User permission validation prevents unauthorized access
- Status transitions validated to prevent manipulation

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for all booking operations
- Lifecycle statistics for monitoring success rates
- Error tracking for failed bookings and retries

### Maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns between services
- Comprehensive test coverage for all features
- Clear documentation and error messages

## Court Configuration

The system is configured for exactly **2 courts**:

- **Court 1**: 10-day booking window (maps to tennis site area value 5: "Cancha de Tenis 1")
- **Court 2**: 9-day booking window (maps to tennis site area value 7: "Cancha de Tenis 2")

### UI Integration Notes
- Frontend will have a court selector dropdown with "Court 1" and "Court 2"
- Each court has its own availability window configuration
- User selects desired court before booking
- System validates availability based on court-specific rules

### Tennis Site Integration
- **Court 1** in our system → **Area value 5** ("Cancha de Tenis 1") on tennis website
- **Court 2** in our system → **Area value 7** ("Cancha de Tenis 2") on tennis website
- This mapping will be handled in Step 2.4 tennis script integration

The booking request service is now complete and ready for tennis script integration in Step 2.4.
